#### How to get Started?
At first clone this repo.
Install the backend dependencies on root folder using `npm install` command.

Set your own credentials for cloudinary and mongodb database on the root folder inside a .env file like below-

Create a .env file in the root and add the following-

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI="Your mongo uri"
JWT_SECRET="Anything you like"
CLOUD_NAME="Your cloudindary name"
API_KEY="Your cloudinary api key"
API_SECRET="Your cloudinary api secret"
```

Move to frontend folder and install frontend dependencies using `npm install` command.

For Google authentication set your own firebase credentials inside a .env file in the frontend folder like following-

```bash
REACT_APP_API_KEY="Your firebase api key"
REACT_APP_AUTHDOMAIN="Your auth domain"
REACT_APP_PROJECTID="Your projectId"
REACT_APP_STORAGEBUCKET="Your bucket"
REACT_APP_MESSAGINGSENDERID="Your messagingsenderId"
REACT_APP_APPID="Your appId"
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENTID="Your measurementId"

```

Note:You can get all these firebase credentials easily by creating a firebase project. You can do this easily by watching youtube videos.

##### After that move to root folder and run `npm run dev` to start backend and frontend at the same time.

And there you go...boom!

All the best,
Vlada
